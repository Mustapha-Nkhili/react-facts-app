# My First React Project - Facts About React

This is my first React project, created as part of the Scrimba course on React. I've built this project from scratch, implementing what I've learned in my own way and not by simply copying and pasting code. In this project, I aim to provide interesting facts about React and demonstrate my understanding of React concepts.
